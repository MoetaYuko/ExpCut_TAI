# Balanced Graph Cut with Exponential Inter-Cluster Compactness

This is the official implementation of our TAI paper _Balanced Graph Cut with Exponential Inter-Cluster Compactness_.

Run `Demo_expcut.m` to reproduce our results and change `data_index` to evaluate on different datasets. The hyperparameters are preset. Tested with MATLAB R2020b.

The source code in `finchpp` folder is based on https://github.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering and slightly modified to fulfill our needs.
